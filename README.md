# Pokemon_SV_Raid_Sim
Simulator for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet raid damage

The initial goal for this project is to have a slimmed down and raid focused version of existing damage calculators, in an effort to more easily and accurately predict if a situation will OHKO a raid boss. Also to hopefully have something that doesn't look like the UI has been copy pasted from the 90s

The end goal for this project is to have a full simulation of raid battles with accurate predictions of what will happen on an action by action basis
